                The information for all orders placed on our site is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology, so your transactions are completely protected. With SSL in place for both the client and the server, the information sent via the Internet will arrive securely (encrypted) via an SSL-enabled browser as most internet browsers today are equipped with SSL. To be sure your connection is secure when filling out the order form, simply check for the padlock icon, which can be visible beside the address bar on most browsers.

            <p class="mt-3">
                TechshopBD doesnâ€™t collect any information related to online banking account of a customer while the customer makes digital payment (through bKash, credit/debit card etc.). The field/window where customers put online banking credentials is entirely provided by the respective online banking authority or trusted 3rd party merchant(s) and TechshopBD has access to NO information on that field/window. As an extra layer of security, each transaction is accompanied by a unique OTP (one time password), which is sent to the customers by their respective online banking authority and is mandatory to complete any digital payment.
